The app follows a modular architecture pattern with the following main modules:

**core:** The core module contains shared resources and configurations essential for the app. 

**data:** This module is responsible for managing data sources, including local storage, remote APIs, and caching. 

**domain:** The domain layer manages the appâ€™s business logic, including use cases and entities. 

**presentation:** Responsible for the UI, this layer uses Jetpack Compose to render views and manage user interactions. 

<H1>Technologies Used</H1>

**Android**

**Jetpack Compose**

**Dagger Hilt**

**JUnit** 

<H1>Android App with Continuous Integration</H1>
